Random programs that perform data analysis tasks of questionable quality. Most of these supply a note that explains what a given program does.

xor256x86: a Xorshift256++ generator for x86_64 seeded using SplitMix64, outputs native-endian sequence of random data.
mtx86: a Mersenne Twister generator for x86_64. Takes a decimal number, outputs native-endian sequence of random data.
