# /dev/urandom

Random programs that perform data analysis tasks of questionable quality. Most of these supply a note that explains what a given program does.

xor256x86: a Xorshift256++ generator for x86_64 seeded using SplitMix64, outputs native-endian sequence of random data.
mtx86: a Mersenne Twister generator for x86_64. Takes a decimal number, outputs native-endian sequence of random data.

Issues/pull requests unwelcome, this is a personal repository. If something doesn't work the way you expect, it was probably intentional.
The rest of programs are used as a partial product in making other software (e.g. DOS32A) and put here merely for convenience.
